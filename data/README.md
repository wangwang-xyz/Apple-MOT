* 'Anthracnose'
* 'Fly speck'
* 'Scab'
* 'Sooty blotch'

## MinneApple:

The MinneApple dataset, which consists of images 
collected in real orchards, can refer to the paper
for details. ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06441) and
[data](https://rsn.umn.edu/projects/orchard-monitoring/minneapple))


## MyData

The data set constructed in this paper is composed 
of images collected by simulation experiments, a 
part of the MinneApple data set and some data sets 
on the network. It contains 1790 pictures, which 
are divided into 1211 in training sets and 579 in test 
sets. Among them, 27,679 apples were marked by hand.


## OpticalFlow

Optical flow test dataset.
